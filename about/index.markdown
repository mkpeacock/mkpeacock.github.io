I'm an experienced development team leader and senior developer from the North East, with a degree in Software Engineering from the University of Durham. I specialise in web based applications of varying complexity with PHP and MySQL, and dabble in iOS development.

Currently, I'm the CTO of Ground Six, a technology company based in Newcastle who create technology based businesses from within Ground Six and in equity parterships to entrepreneurial people with a great idea. Recent projects include:

- Faceifi
- Democrasay
- Kindest
- Bdaily
- Grahams Fan

Before joining Ground Six, I worked on developing Smith Link, the web based vehicle telematics platform for Smith Electric Vehicles, an interesting and challenging project working with over 1.5 billion data inserts per day. Before Smith, I co-founded Peacock Carter, a web design and development agency which I co-ran for 5 years; hiring a developmen team and leading the development across a range of projects.

I've used my knowledge and experience to write seven web development books, act as technical reviewer for another three, and present to audiences at user groups and conferences on a range of technical topics.
