**Full Disclosure:** I'm a full time member of the Ground Six team (more on that in a future post), so this review is *slightly* biased, however its a great milestone for us so I felt the need to share it.

Today marks the official launch of SalesJump, an iPhone app developed by Ground Six, a web and mobile app company based in Newcastle.

SalesJump is a mobile app designed for businesses to keep track of their quotes and leads, and to make decisions from their conversion data and other trends. From using the app myself, some of the highlights I like are finding quick decision makers and working out optimal prices i.e. which services quoted at which prices are more likely to convert to sales.

This is Ground Six's first version of their first app, so feedback and suggestions are welcome to help the team improve and shape the app going forward.

[Get the app](http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/salesjump/id519114052?ls=1&mt=8).
